This code simulates a simple coffee machine that can make different types of coffee drinks
(espresso, latte, and cappuccino) based on user inputs. The machine also allows users to
check the current status of resources (water, milk, coffee, and money) and manage
transactions for purchasing drinks.

Usage
1)The user is prompted to choose a drink or to check the report.
2)If a drink is chosen, the machine checks if there are enough ingredients.
3)If there are sufficient resources, the user is asked to input the amount of money.
4)If the payment is sufficient, the drink is made, resources are updated, and any
change is returned to the user.
5)The report command displays the current resources.
6)The off command stops the machine.
